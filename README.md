# hashing-banklist
HashMap and LinkedHashMap through the banklist

banklist.txt file that contains information about banks that have failed.

This Java application will :
a.	Read the data from a comma delimited text file that stores data in the appropriate format
b.	Using a HashMap store the name of the city state combination as key and the number of times this combination occurs in the file
c.	Using LinkedHashMap iterate through the results and determine which city,state had the most bank failures
